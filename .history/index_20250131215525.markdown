## About Me
I’m Quhura Fathima, a Computer Science graduate student at Old Dominion University with over 2 years of experience in full-stack development, database optimization, and cloud deployment. My technical expertise spans Java, Python, C++, JavaScript, SAP HANA, MySQL, and cloud platforms like AWS and Azure. I have a strong foundation in Cybersecurity, AI, and ML, with practical experience in implementing secure systems and developing data-driven solutions. In addition, I’ve worked at Accenture as an Application Development Associate, where I optimized database performance and automated processes, and at Cognizant, where I contributed to database management and business intelligence reporting. Beyond my technical skills, I am the President of ACM-W at Old Dominion University, leading initiatives to empower women in computing and foster community engagement. I am always eager to learn and apply new technologies to solve real-world problems, and I enjoy contributing to the tech community through leadership and collaboration.
